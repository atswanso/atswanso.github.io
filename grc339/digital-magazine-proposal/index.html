            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            
            <h3>Mega-Bite</h3>
            
            <p>Mega-Bite is a website for up-and-coming music to be shared, discussed, and reviewed. On our website, users can find articles on popular releases, rising artists in the genre, tools to transform your own sound as a musician, and even synth history. Mega-Bite is a resource that focuses specifically on synth and electronic music. Since the site is contributor based, meaning pieces are shared by anyone and reviewed by staff, music can be subcategorized in a plethora of ways. This feature makes Mega-Bite a valuable website for longtime music-heads to discuss "proper" categorization, or new listeners to discover niche genres never heard before. </p><!--Short description of the magazine-->
