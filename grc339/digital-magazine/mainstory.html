            <h2>Buc-ee’s: The Largest Gas Station on planet Earth (in Luling, Texas)</h2>
            <p>
               Buc-ee’s station is located specifically in New Braunfels, Texas, on Interstate 35 (see location). The gas station has more than 120 refueling stations, 83 restrooms, 31 cash registers, restaurants, bars and various stores.

               Buc-ee’s, claimed the title of top-rated gas station brand in the United States, based on performance in the “overall” rating category. This Texan gas station serves drivers with the simple idea of giving gas at a good price and having clean restrooms.</p>
            <p>
               A striking aspect about this gas station is the beaver in its logo, the origin of its choice is due to the nickname of its founder Arch “Beaver” Aplin and has become a popular sign of identity for his loyal followers, who have worn T-shirts, caps and all kinds of souvenirs sold in the same store. Clever strategy!</p>

            <p>
               The convenience store is the largest in the world with an area of 68,000 square feet and its visitors can enjoy 4 Ice machines and 80 fountain dispensers. If that wasn’t enough, the store was also named the 2012 “Best Bathroom in America,” earning the Cintas Award.

               In late 2018, Buc-ee’s announced an agreement with Tooshlights to place special indicator lights in restrooms to alert customers to which stalls are occupied or not. This is similar to the indicator lights used in some parking facilities that tell drivers which parking spaces are available and which are not. Katy’s and Temple Buc-ee stores would be the first to get the special indicator lights for the restroom.</p>
            <p>Buc-ee’s car wash in Katy, Texas, is the longest in the world at 56,000 square feet, 85 yards long and has every possible tool to get your vehicle shining again.</p>

            <p>
               An exaggerated amount of brushes and jets, scrubs and dries every car like never before. If a visitor needs to vacuum the interior, there are 32 stations, so they probably won’t have to wait. At 255 feet long, the car wash is slightly shorter than a football field, plus the car wash has 17 blowers and 32 vacuum stations.

               The success of this U.S. chain might make many think that “everything is already done”; however, this is not the case, because despite having such records, it is not the end of the road and there are plans for new locations for its gas stations in Colorado, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Virginia and Wisconsin.

               This raises concerns as to whether in the near future this station will continue to hold the record as the largest in the world or whether a new facility will take the title away, as the company has been replicating its successful model in various regions across the United States. Can it be surpassed?            </p>
